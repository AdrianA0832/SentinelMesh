# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
This is a local-first tool. If you find a security issue, please open an issue on the repository.

## Design Principles
- **Minimal Privilege**: Does not require Root/Admin to run (though ARP scanning is better with it).
- **Sanitization**: Inputs are minimal. No user content injection possible.
- **Dependencies**: Minimal dependency tree to reduce supply chain risk.
